# Hintflow

HintFlow is a lightweight and easy-to-configure React library for creating dismissable in-app cues, helping you guide users through new features or important changes in a non-intrusive way.

## Features

- **Non-Intrusive Cues**: Display subtle popups to inform users about new features or important updates.
- **Configurable Positioning**: Place cues above, below, left, or right of target elements.
- **Persistent Dismissal**: Cues won't reappear for users who have already seen and dismissed them.
- **Easy Integration**: Quickly integrate with any React component using simple props.

## Installation

Install the library using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install hintflow
```
or 
```bash
yarn add hintflow
```
